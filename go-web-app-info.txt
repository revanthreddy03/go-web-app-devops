What to do:

containarise the app                    - DONE  
{problem faced: docker login solution: sudo docker login }

create EKS K8S cluster using terraform    - DONE
{problem faced: scp denied error in terraform console.
    solution: Able to create cluster from Plural sight provided AWS console,
    but they explicitly denied eks:createCluster api call in SCP (Dont know How?)
    Also they only allow ec2 instance type till t3.medium, so created self managed node group
    as there is no option to configure instance type in EKS managed node group}


Test app deployed in cluster
    create a functional eks cluster with managed ec2 nodes                      - DONE
    test deploy a app, create nodeport and test access using ec2 node external ip - DONE
    {problem: which subnets to select for cluster, managed nodes
    solution: eks cluster will be managed by AWS, AWS need subnets only to create ENI in these
    subnets to create door for EKS to be in our VPC so public/private subnets are fine.
    For managed nodes as i need to debug website access from internet i deployed in public subnets
    for production better deploy in private subnets.}
    deploy ingress                                          - DONE                                     
    deploy a nginx lb controller                            - DONE
    test access                                             - DONE
